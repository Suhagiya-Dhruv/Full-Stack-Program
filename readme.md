## Type of Operators
---
1. Arithmetic Operators
    - These operators are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. Examples: (+, -, *, /, %)
2. Increment Operators
    - This operatora are used to perform increment by one (++)
    - post increment
    - pre increment
3. Decrement Operators
     - This operatora are used to perform decrement by one (--)
    - post decrement
    - pre decrement
4. Relational Operators
    - These are used for the comparison of the values of two operands. For example, checking if one operand is equal to the other operand or not, whether an operand is greater than the other operand or not, etc. Some of the relational operators are (==, >, <, >= , <=, != )
5. Logical Operators
    - Logical Operators are used to combining two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition in consideration. The result of the operation of a logical operator is a Boolean value either true or false. 
    - AND (&&)
    - OR (||)
    - Not (!)
6. Bitwise Operators (Not requirement)
    - The Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on the operands. The operators are first converted to bit-level and then the calculation is performed on the operands. Mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. can be performed at the bit level for faster processing.
    - AND (&)
    - OR (|)
    - Right shift (>>)
    - Left shift (<<)
    - Not(~)
    - XOR(^)
7. Assignment Operators
    - Assignment operators are used to assign value to a variable. The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable and the right side operand of the assignment operator is a value. The value on the right side must be of the same data type as the variable on the left side otherwise the compiler will raise an error.
    - Example (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
8. Conditional Operator
    - The conditional operator is of the form ( ? : )
    - Example (Expression1? Expression2: Expression3)
    - Here, Expression1 is the condition to be evaluated. If the condition(Expression1) is True then we will execute and return the result of Expression2 otherwise if the condition(Expression1) is false then we will execute and return the result of Expression3.
